# Physically-Unclonable-Functions-for-Hardware-Security
PUF is a digital Fingerprint used to prevent semi-conductor device designs of a particular company to be stolen, copied or remade by the Foundry or any other company. This project was to analyze which out of Ring or Butterfly PUFs work the best for Hardware Security. THe PUFs were tested on an FPGA to analyze the hardware area consumed, resouce utilization and pwer consumed.

THese are basically functions added to the main code of the design, to generate random results each time the desig is copied, making ti impossible ot decode the actual design of the device.
